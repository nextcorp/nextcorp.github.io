		<h2>
			Why smoke Weed everyday?
		</h2>
		<center><img src="/img/weed-63.jpg" alt="Weed Picture"></center>
		<p>
		Surprising to no one, regulatory drug agencies believe that daily weed smoking can indeed be harmful. Lung-related problems are naturally the biggest concern among smokers and researchers. <strong>According to <a href=http://www.drugabuse.gov>http://www.drugabuse.gov</a></strong>:</p>
		
		<center><i>"People who smoke marijuana frequently can have the same breathing problems as those who smoke tobacco. These problems include daily cough and phlegm, more frequent lung illness, and a higher risk of lung infections."</i>
		</center>
		
		<p>
			<strong>
				But other studies, including one conducted by the American Thoracic Society's medical journal, concluded that,
			</strong>
		</p>

			<i>
				Lifetime marijuana use is not associated with adverse changes in spirometry (exhalation strength) of lung health
			</i>
		</center>
		
		<p>
			Their data suggests it's unlikely that prolonged cannabis use would cause respiratory diseases in the same manner as tobacco and a growing number of researchers are reaching the same conclusion.
			In spite of the U.S. government's public stance on the harmful nature of marijuana smoking, a government released report in 2011 concluded that regular marijuana smoking (equivalent to a joint a day) did not impair lung function. According to the New York Times,
			he researchers followed more than 5,000 people over two decades and found that regularly smoking marijuana did not impair performance on a lung function test.
In fact, cannabis users 'performed slightly better on the lung function test.'
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			What about daily use on the brain?
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			Medical Director of the Caron Treatment Centers, Dr. Joseph Garbely told USA Today that daily use leads to slower brain function and a host of other impairments.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>
				Daily use promotes a chronic loss of attention, focus and concentration. Daily users perform at a lower level at jobs and at school. Focus and motivation also decrease. About 15% of cannabis users develop an addiction. Daily users suffer memory coordination, and problem-solving issues.
			</i>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Given cannabis' federal Schedule I classification, data regarding the effects of daily use is lacking. However, cannabis advocates might be prone to disagree with Dr. Garbely's assessments. Some of the world's top performing athletes, entrepreneurs, scholars, artists and other professionals profess to either smoking daily, or having smoked daily in the past.
			Of course, it's difficult to know whether these are exceptions to the rule and if there happen to be legions of talented people in the world whose weed habit has stunted their potential in some way so, it's anyone's guess.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			But it may also be argued that hyper-motivated people are going to be this way regardless of their daily smoking habit and will most likely find ways to be productive at the same time.
		
		
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Addiction woes
		</h3>
		
		<p>
			It can be said that daily use, if not medicinal can lead to a cannabis dependency. But is it harmful? Well that largely depends upon how it affects specific people and how many negative benefits are derived from its use on a case-by-case basis.
	
			Those who have developed a psychological dependence may be using it as a crutch, rather than dealing with certain underlying conditions. In this case, cannabis use can delay the proper treatment of such conditions.
			
			If one is experiencing bad physical reactions, like an elevated heart rate that may cause anxiety, or increased respiratory infections and still continues to use, this is also an indicator of an unhealthy relationship with cannabis that should be addressed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The bottom line? Be honest with yourself regarding whether daily use is helping or hurting you.
		
			Marijuana may get a bad rep in the media as far as the decriminalization debate goes, but its health benefits can no longer go unnoticed. With various studies linking long-term marijuana use to positive, health-related effects, <strong>there are more than just a few reasons to smoke some weed everyday:</strong>
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>1. You're just as likely to pay your doctor a visit as your non-weed consuming counterparts.</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			A study done by the Boston Medical Center and the Boston University of Medicine, examined 589 drug users—more than 8 out of 10 of whom were pot smokers. It determined that “weed aficionados” were no more likely to visit the doctor than non-drug users. If an increased risk of contracting ailments is what's preventing you from smoking more weed, it looks like you're in the clear!
			
			
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>2. Marijuana is a natural pain reliever.</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			One of the greatest medicinal benefits of marijuana is its pain relieving qualities, which make it especially effective for treating chronic pain. From menstruation cramps to nerve pain, as little as three puffs of bud a day can help provide the same relief as synthetic painkillers. Marijuana relieves pain by “changing the way the nerves function,” says Mark Ware, MD and assistant professor of anesthesia and family medicine at McGill University.
			
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>3.Weed helps boost your creativity</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			Some of the greatest artists from the past and present have all turned to bud to help unlock their creativity. From William Shakespeare to Rihanna, there's just no getting around the fact that a great high will help get the creative juices flowing-perhaps even spurring you to create your next great masterpiece.
			
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>4. Marijuana use has been medically linked to decreased joint inflammation.</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			Studies have found that patients suffering from arthritis could benefit from marijuana use. This is because naturally occurring chemicals in cannabis work to activate pathways in the body that help fight off joint inflammation.
		
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>5. Smoking more weed may help regulate your weight.</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that individuals who smoked weed were less prone to obesity than non-marijuana users. Another article published in the American Journal of Medicine showed that individuals who smoked weed had smaller waist circumferences than those who did not.
		
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><u>6. Marijuana may help regulate your blood sugar.</u></strong></p>
		<p align="justify">
			The same American Journal of Medicine study also found that subjects who smoked marijuana exhibited lower insulin levels, and had 'better carbohydrate metabolism than nonusers.' Both factors play an important role in lowering the risk of developing diabetes.
			
		</p>
		
		<h2 align="center">
			If you weren't convinced that smoking weed everyday was good before, we're sure the reasons above are enough to sway you now. So go on, take a toke and reap the benefits of cannabis.
